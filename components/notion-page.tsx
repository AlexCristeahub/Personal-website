            Everything about my journey as a young founder you can find in this blog.
            That means apps that I have been working on, behind the scenes, tips & tricks and some opinions about other stuff.
            In the past few months I have been thinking about how much it would benefit people to see where to start from in this space so that you don't have to figure out everything by yourself.
            That's why I created this blog, to show the people what the process looks like.

            The right tools can make or break a remote team's success. Communication platforms, project management
            software, and collaborative design tools have become the backbone of distributed teams worldwide.

            As we look toward the future, remote work is here to stay. The companies that adapt and embrace these
            changes will be the ones that thrive in the new economy.
